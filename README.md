# PAYSTAND INTERVIEW PROJECT

As a full-time researcher and student, I often work in long, uninterrupted stretches. Friends, family, and loved ones message me, but I frequently forget to respond or reply hours later. This is a real personal bottleneck. Since iMessage is deeply integrated into macOS, building an AI assistant that monitors messages, surfaces replies, and generates mood-aligned drafts directly improves my daily communication without breaking focus.

# IMESSAGEAI

An AI auto-reply suggestor for iMessage text notifications. Set which numbers to include or exclude from suggestions. Describe yourself and your moods, and choose from several suggestions based on those moods.
